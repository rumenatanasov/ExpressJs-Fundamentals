 Set up MongoDB and Mongoose

Initially make sure to have installed MongoDB on your machine. Next, cool UI program for visualizing data and

schema would be pretty nice. For this lab is used RoboMongo – you can choose any other alternative you like or

none at all.

To make sure that everything is up and ready run this command in command prompt:

mongod -- dbpath {yourCustomPath}

yourCustomPath – place where database files generated from MongoDB will be stored

*Note that: -- dbpath {yourCustomPath} is optional by default and it will store information in &quot;C:\data\db –

if such directory exists

After the command is executed some output (or simply called 'noise') should be printed. If everything goes well the

program will continue working. Do not close the window because it is our connection to database.

Warning: Keep in mind that when you are working with any application which connects MongoDB - this window

should always be open!
